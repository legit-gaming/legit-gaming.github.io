## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for making the web interactive.  The webpages we visit are not that smart by themselves and need instructions on what to do.  We can write JavaScript to provide these instructions, which can be used to create games, send messages to friends, and buy things.  We will specifically learn how to use JavaScript for creating games. 

To make games, we might not want to use JavaScript by itself and could use some help from HTML and CSS.  HTML and CSS can draw elements on webpages, while JavaScript can bring these objects to life.  We can use these technologies to create fun games, which we can share with our friends.  JavaScript tells the computer how to do things like keep track of score, move elements on the screen, and know when a game is won or lost.

If you want to brush up on your HTML and CSS, then take a look at the webpages below.  However, we will not be writing a lot of HTML and CSS.

Take a look at the games below to get an idea of what we can make with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  We will focus on creating a couple of these games from scratch.
