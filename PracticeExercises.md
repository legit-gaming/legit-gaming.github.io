## Understanding the Basics: Thimble Practice Exercises

### Before You Get Started
* **Make sure to add: <script src="script.js"></script> within the &lt;head> tags in your .html file**
* **Uncheck the Auto run option next to Preview. You can run/refresh your JavaScript by clicking the arrow next to Preview on the right display panel.**
* **Note: sometimes you have to refresh 2 or 3 times before your new JavaScript code picks up - takes a few minutes to pick up the changes.**
* **FYI on Comments**
  * Use &nbsp;&nbsp;  //**code** &nbsp;&nbsp;   to comment out a single line of code
  * Use &nbsp;&nbsp; /* **code** */ &nbsp;&nbsp; to comment out a block of code (multiple lines of code)
